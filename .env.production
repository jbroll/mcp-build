# The mcp-build service now uses CLI arguments instead of environment variables.
# Configuration is managed through deploy.conf and passed via systemd ExecStart.
#
# See deploy.conf for the current configuration approach:
#   - Session key is passed via --session-key argument
#   - Transport, host, and port are specified via CLI flags
#   - Working directory is set in systemd WorkingDirectory
#
# This file is kept for reference only and will not be deployed.
